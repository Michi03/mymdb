## Widget for user initialization
The purpose of this widget is to upload some basic user information mainly the imdb list of rated movies.
Right now this is solely based on a 'ratings.csv' file but should be expanded to also work with a user-url or simply a imdb session cookie.
The idea right now is to provide the opportunity of using the extention more or less anonymously by only uploading a 'ratings.csv' file which will be linked to a random id not the imdb-user id.
